# Data Structures and Algorithms I (DSA-I)

This repository contains my foundational work in Data Structures and Algorithms. It covers the implementation and complexity analysis of both linear and non-linear data structures.

## | Overview |

### Linear Data Structures
* **Arrays:** Linear & Binary Search, Memory Mapping.
* **Linked Lists:** Singly, Doubly, and Circular Linked Lists; Slow/Fast Pointer techniques.
* **Stacks & Queues:** Implementations using both Arrays and Linked Lists.

### Sorting & Complexity
* **Complexity Analysis:** Big O, Omega, Theta notations; Best/Worst case analysis.
* **Basic Sorts:** Count Sort (Linear Time).
* **Advanced Sorts:** Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort.

### Hierarchical & Non-Linear Structures
* **Trees:** Binary Trees, BST Operations (Insert, Delete), and Traversal Algorithms (Pre/In/Post-order).
* **Heaps:** Priority Queue implementation and Heap Sort.
* **Graphs:** Adjacency Matrix/List representations; BFS & DFS Traversals; Topological Sort.

## Implementation Details
- **Focus:** Understanding memory management and pointer logic.
- **Goal:** Achieving optimal Time and Space complexity for each structure.
